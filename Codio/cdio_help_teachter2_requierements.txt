1.
Create a Python function called get_grade(subject) that prompts the user to input a grade for the specified subject.
The function should handle any invalid input gracefully.
requierements:
    Accept a parameter subject (str) representing the subject for which the grade is being input.
    Prompt the user to input a grade for the specified subject. Look at demo for guidance.
    Handle any invalid input (e.g., non-numeric grades).
    If the input was invalid, prompt the user to enter a valid grade until one is received.
    Return the grade as a float.

2.
Create a Python function that prompts the user to input the student’s name, English grade, and Math grade.
name: get_student_info()
requierements:
    Prompt the user to input the student’s name.
    Prompt the user to input the student’s English grade. Use the get_grade function you’ve written in the previous step.
    Prompt the user to input another grade for Math, the same way.
    Return a dictionary containing the student’s name, English grade, and Math grade.

3. In the main() function, prompt the user to input the number of students.
Then, collect information for each student.
Append all student dictionaries to a single list, thus creating a nested structure - a list of dicts.

4.
Create a function called print_student_info(students).
The function will take a list of student dictionaries as an argument,

and print out the student’s name, best grade, and average grade in a formatted manner.
Call this function from your main() function,
so that it outputs the information (See demo for the final output).
